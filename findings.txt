1Ô∏è Free Arbitrage Exploit
Attacker swaps back and forth to drain one token while making a profit.

 Scenario:
Token A (ETH) = from token
Token B (USDC) = to token

Initial Pool Reserves:
100 ETH
200,000 USDC
Attacker starts with 10 ETH.
Attacker calculates the swap price for swapping 10 ETH into USDC:
10*200,000/100 = 20,000 USDC
Attacker receives 20,000 USDC.

New reserves:
110 ETH
180,000 USDC
Swap back USDC for ETH using the same formula:
20,000*110/180,000 = 12.22 ETH
Attacker receives 12.22 ETH (profit of 2.22 ETH).

New reserves:
97.78 ETH
200,000 USDC
Repeat to drain Token A (ETH)

Since the price is calculated without updating reserves dynamically, 
the attacker keeps swapping back and forth, slowly extracting free ETH.
